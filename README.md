Budget Planner App
Description
The Budget Planner App is a React Native project that helps users manage their finances effectively by categorizing income, expenses, and savings. Built with a focus on modularity and reusable components, this app integrates several fundamental and advanced concepts of React Native.

Features
Dynamic Component Creation: Components are generated dynamically from a structured data source for reusability and flexibility.
Custom Components: Modular components like Card and Category enhance the structure and maintainability of the app.
Props and State Management: The app leverages props for passing data between components and useState for managing state across the application.
ScrollView Implementation: Smooth horizontal scrolling for category navigation with adjustable visual cues.
Conditional Rendering: Different views are rendered based on user interactions (e.g., switching between categories and their details).
Screens Management: A structured navigation system to switch between the main screen and detailed views for specific categories.
Flexbox Layouts: Responsive layouts designed using Flexbox for a seamless user experience.
Styling: Customized and dynamic styling for every component, including conditional coloring and shadows for enhanced visuals.
Media Integration: Integration of images for each category and the ability to expand functionality for videos or additional media.
Libraries Integration: Use of third-party libraries to extend functionality (e.g., SafeAreaView for platform-safe rendering).
